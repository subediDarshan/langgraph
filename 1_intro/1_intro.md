# Agentic AI

Agentic Al is a type of Al that can take up a task or goal from
a user and then work toward completing it on its own, with
minimal human guidance.
It plans, takes action, adapts to changes, and seeks help
only when necessary.

### Autonomous

#### Autonomy can be controlled

a. Permission Scope - Limit what tools or actions the agent can perform independently. (Can screen
candidates, but needs approval before rejecting anyone.)


b. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) - Insert checkpoints where human approval is required before
continuing. (Can I post this JD)


c. Override Controls - Allow users to stop, pause, or change the agent's behavior at any time. (pause
screening command to halt resume processing.)


d. Guardrails / Policies - Define hard rules or ethical boundaries the agent must follow. (Never
schedule interviews on weekends)


#### Autonomy can be dangerous

a. The application autonomously sends out job offers with incorrect salaries or terms.

b. The application shortlists candidates by age or nationality, violating anti-discrimination laws.

c. The applications spending extra on LinkedIn ads.
